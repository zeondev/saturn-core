## What's this about?
Saturn Core is a base template for starting with a web app, This allows you to quickly mock up applications.

## What can it do?
With Saturn Core, you can write everything with pure JavaScript. We have created a packaging system so you can split multiple JavaScript files which means that your main file isn't messy. You can also create muliple instances of one package allowing to deploy multiple instances of JavaScript files.

Prequisites: node.js - for basic express server

Clone this repository and go into the `src` folder, then run the `index.js` file to start the server. If you want to use an alternative server, use the `public` folder as the root.
