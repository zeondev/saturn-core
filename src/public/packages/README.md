# How to use the package structure

Having a valid package requires 3 things: category, author, and package name.   
These three combined together create a path to the package.
For example, `ui/ZeonDev-Test.js` would be the category `ui`, the author of `ZeonDev` and package name of `Test`.
Categories are just a way of organising apps. We have provided some base categories of `apps`, `lib`, `service`, and `ui`. You can always add or remove categories by creating folders in this directory.

TL;DR Files should be named as `OwnerName-PackageName.js` and be inside the category you want.
